Key Factors Behind the Outperformance
Index Fund Effects and Liquidity Premium
The primary reason for Class B shares’ outperformance appears to be related to index fund inclusion and liquidity dynamics. As noted in Swedish investment discussions, both Class A and Class B shares are included in major indices. However, since Class B shares represent only about 2% of all outstanding shares (with Class A representing 98%), they have much lower liquidity and trading volume.
When index funds rebalance or purchase shares, they buy both classes proportionally. However, the limited supply of Class B shares creates a liquidity premium - the lower float means that relatively small purchase volumes can drive prices higher more easily than with the highly liquid Class A shares

Share Buyback Program Impact
Your mention of the February 2025 share buyback announcement is relevant. The bank’s board proposed authorization to repurchase up to 120 million Class A and/or Class B shares. This buyback authorization, combined with the extraordinary dividend of SEK 7.50 per share announced in February 2025 (in addition to the ordinary dividend of SEK 7.50), likely contributed to positive sentiment for both share classes.

However, the buyback program may have had a disproportionate impact on Class B shares due to their lower liquidity. When buyback programs target both share classes, the effect on the less liquid Class B shares tends to be more pronounced.

Market Structure Inefficiency
This performance differential highlights a classic market inefficiency. Both share classes have identical dividend rights and represent the same underlying business, with the only difference being voting rights (Class A has one vote per share, Class B has one-tenth vote per share). In an efficient market, this voting premium should be minimal, especially given that Class A shares already represent 98% of the total.



Conclusion
The outperformance of Class B shares appears to be primarily driven by market microstructure effects rather than fundamental factors. The combination of index fund purchasing patterns, lower liquidity creating a scarcity premium, and the share buyback program has created conditions where Class B shares have significantly outperformed their Class A counterparts. This represents a market inefficiency that experienced investors like yourself often identify - identical economic exposure trading at different implicit valuations due to structural factors rather than fundamental differences.
